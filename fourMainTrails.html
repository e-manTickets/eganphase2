<div class="trail">Blue Trail</div>
  <p>This easy-to-moderate 12.3-mile long trail ascends from Staten Island Boulevard and crosses the crest of Todt Hill, one of the highest points on the Eastern Seaboard between Maine and Florida.</p> 

  <div class="trail">White Trail </div>
  <p>The southern end of this easy-to-moderate 7.6-mile long trail connects to Great Kills Park, part of the Gateway National Recreation Area. The northern tip is in Willowbrook Park. The White Trail passes through Egbertville Ravine, Heyerdahl Hill and Buck’s Hollow. The trail also passes the Greenbelt Nature Center, which, at the halfway point, is a great place to stop for a break.</p>

  <div class="trail">Red Trail</div> 
  <p>This easy-to-moderate 4-mile long loop trail is in the heart of the Greenbelt; it crosses over Buck’s Hollow, Heyerdahl Hill, the northern edge of LaTourette golf course and the neighborhood of Lighthouse Hill. This trail has an extension leading downhill to Historic Richmondtown near St. Patrick’s Place.</p>

  <div class="trail">Yellow Trail</div> 
  <p>This moderate-to-difficult 8-mile long trail brings hikers through Reeds Basket Willow Swamp. It ascends Todt Hill, then parallels the Blue Trail. Moses’ Mountain is located off the Yellow Trail off Rockland Avenue near High Rock Park.</p>

  <div class="trail">The Nature Center Trail</div>
  <p>The one-mile long Nature Center Trail begins at “Mitchell Crossing,” the wooden footbridge on the eastern edge of the Nature Center grounds. The semi-circular trail leads to a native fern garden stretching out under a canopy of tall tulip, beech and birch trees. In spring, Canada mayflower, trout lilies and wild violets proliferate. Observant hikers may get a glimpse of chipmunks, moles, a large variety of songbirds, and perhaps the occasional white-tailed or red-tailed hawk. In the spring, you can hear the call of spring peepers in the vernal ponds along the trail. The level terrain and short distance is suitable for novice hikers. A leg of this trail known as the “E Trail” was designed for the little steps of our early childhood visitors.</p> 

  <div class="trail">Multipurpose Trail</div>
  <p>The multipurpose trail differs greatly from Greenbelt woodland trails. This new, pedestrian-friendly trail is also the only trail on which bike-riding is permitted. The mostly flat 2.6 mile circuit has a crushed gravel surface and six-foot wide walkways. It extends westward from Rockland Avenue along Forest Hill Road hugging the perimeter of LaTourette golf course toward Richmond Avenue. The Yellow and Blue trails intersect the multipurpose trail here (see trail map). About midway, a leg of the trail branches off toward Historic Richmond Town/St. Andrews Church at Old Mill Road at the base of Richmond Hill Road (aka Snake Hill). The multipurpose trail has been a boon to the running community and recreational walkers and cyclists. Segments of it are utilized for the Greenbelt’s annul Cold Feat 10K race in February.</p>
